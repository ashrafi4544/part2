# Exercise 2.18.-2.20: Countries App

This exercise involves creating an app that fetches and displays data about countries using an external API (such as the REST Countries API). Users can filter the list of countries by name, and when a country is selected, detailed information (including its capital, population, languages, flag, and even current weather conditions) is shown.

## Key Features:
- Filter countries by name.
- Display comprehensive details for each country.
- Fetch external data via APIs (e.g., REST Countries API and a weather API).

## Technologies Used:
- React (for building the user interface)
- Axios (to perform HTTP requests)
- External APIs: REST Countries and a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
