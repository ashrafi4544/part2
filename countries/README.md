# Exercise 2.18-2.20: Countries App

This exercise involves creating an app that fetches and displays data about countries using external APIs (such as the REST Countries API). Users can filter the list of countries by name, and when a country is selected, detailed information—including its capital, population, languages, flag, and even current weather conditions—is shown.

## Key Features:
- Filter countries by name.
- Display comprehensive details for each country.
- Fetch external data via APIs (e.g., REST Countries API and a weather API such as OpenWeatherMap).

## Technologies Used:
- React (for building the user interface)
- Axios (to perform HTTP requests)
- External APIs: REST Countries API and a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

## Setup and Run Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. In your project directory, open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm install
